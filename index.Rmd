Welcome!

I am a third-year PhD candidate in Human and Molecular Genetics (and a concentration in Quantitative Genetics) at Virginia Commonwealth University.

My area of interest is in complex behavioral genetics, and my current focus is on the genetics of alcohol consumption using mouse models. I love the challenge of teasing apart the genetic influences behind behavioral phenotypes: how can we identify and prioritize which genes are affecting a behavior and start to understand the mechanisms at work?

In addition to my research, I am also passionate about data science, diversity and inclusion in genetics research, and education.

If you'd like a more formal breakdown of my research work and interests, please check out my [biosketch](biosketch.html). Alternately, if you'd like to get in touch feel free to [email me](mailto:tatomz@vcu.edu).
